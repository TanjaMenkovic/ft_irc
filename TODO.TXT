*******************   TESTS IN IRSSI   *********************************************

- When user connects to server in irssi, creates a channel and then other users join that
  channel, users already on that channel receiva message in format:

  user [~user@freenode-l2g.s3h.4nuk5f.IP] has joined #channel1

- If you are part of an channel and you try to join to the same channel again, the client
  will only switch to the window that is on the channel if youre not already viewing that
  window.


*******************     QUESTIONS     *********************************************

-Since user is supposed to be able to be connected on multiple channels, should the user class have a 
vector of channels which will enable the change of nickname through all the channels the user is connected into?

-Do we need to keep track of the channel where we are at the moment, since it seems that MODE is creating different
type of errors for these  situations:
    if channel doen't exist: No such channel
    if we are not at correct channel: You're not on that channel
    if not operator: You're not channel operator

******************      NEXT       *************************************************

-Server will most likely need a name for example the welcome message the client is expecting

-Need to parse users information and save it somewhere

-Figure out how to continue after client has connected with server

-write code for the commands.

-Rework the message I/O so that we are able to send messages bigger than the buffersize.
