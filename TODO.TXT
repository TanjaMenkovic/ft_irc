*******************     QUESTIONS     *********************************************

-Since user is supposed to be able to be connected on multiple channels, should the user class have a 
vector of channels which will enable the change of nickname through all the channels the user is connected into?

******************      NEXT       *************************************************

-Server will most likely need a name for example the welcome message the client is expecting

-Need to parse users information and save it somewhere

-Figure out how to continue after client has connected with server

-write code for the commands.

-Rework the message I/O so that we are able to send messages bigger than the buffersize.
